# Scribus Open Source Desktop Publishing

Scribus was definitely something that I grew to love out of sheer hated of how
Adobe created PDF's and that a lot of people said use LibreOffice and then those
PDF's would just come out looking weird or like they were from Windows 95. So,
I embarked on learning how to use Scribus.

At first, it definitely felt clunky, I didn't know why I couldn't just enter
text on the screen and why I had to define a text box when all I wanted was to
put text on the dumb page. So, I stopped for a bit and went back to LaTeX and
was happy. Don't get me wrong, LaTeX does amazing things, however, the stuff I
wanted to make was not being put out in LaTeX form, nor did I know how to make
my own LaTeX packages. I wanted to make a Genesys Foundry styled document for
use with a Pokemon setting conversion I wanted to do. The templates and files
put out were all in Adobe InDesign and Photoshop formats.

This is where Scribus comes in. While it didn't seem to import the `.imdl`
that Fantasy Flight Games provided on their Genesys Foundry page on DriveThruRPG
I was determined to make it work. I had to rebuild the styles and install the
fonts I needed that were provided by Fantasy Flight Games. Once I got all those
created, it was starting to look really good. I was able to position and land
images, make SVG's within the program itself, and figure out a writer's workflow
so that I could focus on my writing in whatever format I want, then import it
into Scribus.

However, there are a few shortcomings I had with Scribus. Sometimes I would
import an SVG from Inkscape and the elements would be off by a few pixes or
smooshed together causing it to lose shape and meaning. Then also the Table
support didn't seem to work as desired. You cannot currently as of 2020-05-06
modify the rows or colums formats and when you try to change certain formatings
Scribus just ignored you. I opened an issue and talked in the `#scribus` IRC
channel on Freenode, but there doesn't seem to be any plan to have it on the
roadmap this year. The same also goes for Table of Contents. You can make them
yourself, however, you can still generate your own Table of Contents, but it
will be very much lineral and no links to sections or things in the Table of
Contents to their respective sections. LaTeX and Affinity rule this section.

However, SVG import and Tables aside, I was able to do everything else I wanted
to do with Scribus. I learned how a Desktop Publisher's workflow should look
and how to make a project.

You could argue that I can just get Affinity Publisher and do the same thing
with better features and its only $50 one-time purchase. Something about
Affinity Publisher just doesn't seem to click in my mind as Scribus did. So, if
you're in a pinch and want to do something nice, use Scribus. If you have $60 to
spend, don't buy your coffee today and buy Affinity and try it out. Otherwise
you can donate to Scribus and help the developers. Make sure to use their
development versions too. You get more features, but at the cost of stability,
which isn't too bad with the features you're getting. Either of these choices is
better than wasting money on Adobe InDesign and their evilness.
