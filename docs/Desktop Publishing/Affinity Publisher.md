# Affinity Publisher for Desktop Publishing

In a different page I discuss the idea of using Scribus for Desktop Publishing.
I love Scribus, however, a lot of people were making a bunch of buzz about this
Affinity Publisher and Designer suite. Affinity seems to have three products
currently that they sell: Designer, Photo, and Publisher. Each of these are
essentially financially advantaged (Cheap) alternatives to Adobe InDesign.
Affinity Publisher can import `.idml` files from Adobe InDesign, and then
convert that to be an `.afpub` format.

Coming from Scribus to Affinity Publisher was a bit easier than coming into it
without knowing anything, but I definitely had my predjucies about it and then
learning curve of its own. Poking around at the menus, taking the time to
understand what they're saying versus how Scribus named it has helped a lot.
I still find the interface a bit clunky at times or hard to know when I can
insert text or double click on the text and add it. I havne't found a Story
Board Editor like Scribus had yet. The table support and SVG imports are much
better than Scribus and their Table of Contents can do mutliple styles of
generation.

Affinity does default to a dark theme in all their products so it looks nice
and appealing especially to those late night editors. Scribus may have a couple
different themes, but I've only ever used the blinding bright theme by default.
I'm still getting used to it, but since I have more experience in Scribus and
LaTeX first, those are my default fallbacks for now until I get more experience
with the Affinity suite.
