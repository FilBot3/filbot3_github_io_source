# About Me

I am just a hobbiest IT guy who loves to use Linux, and thinks that a Linux Admin is nothing different than that of the other fancy industry terms. They generally have to understand how to do full stack development to make the OS do what they want anyways.

I do a bit of development as a hobby, and I also like to work on making my life easier with tech. I also play video games, and board games and do some role playing with Fantasy Flight Games' Genesys Core System, and then also Hero System, Savage Worlds, and D&D 5e.

See the bottom of the pages for ways to get a hold of me for things.
