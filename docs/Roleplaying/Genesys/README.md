# Genesys Core System

Genesys Core System by Fantasy Flight Games is an amazing, narratively driven
Roleplaying System that is great for dramatic story telling and challenging
degrees of success or failure because of how the narrative dice work. You can
use regular dice, but using their custom dice with the symbols work better, be
it the Star Wars RPG or Genesys Dice packs.

This game is fairly cool and plays well into my desires in a Role-Playing Game,
where teh Game Master and Players can collaborate in game time or before the
first session to build a world or change elements to their favor in the story.
It's called the Narrative Dice System, and it's there to provide grey areas
beyond pass or failure, but Success with Threats and a Triumph or Failure with
Advantages and a Dispair. There are a number of configurations and then the
probabilities go up the more dice you add.

In early 2020, Asmodee and Fantasy Flight Games cut their RPG Department staff
and handed the ownership of Genesys and the Star Wars Roleplaying Game to a
studio called EDGE Studio. However, most of their links for Fantasy Flight
Games' products are still on their page.

This hasn't stopped the community though. Fantasy Flight Games did setup the
[Genesys Foundry](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/cc/27/genesys-foundry) where
community content creators can go on and publish their original works. These
can be adventures for official settings like Realsm of Terrinoth or Shadow of
the Beanstalk, or the they can be whole new settings, adventures, or supplements
for the Genesys game. There is a wealth of great stuff on the Genesys Foundry.

Wealth is also found in its people. The community of Genesys is also very
active and vibrant with many creative people and those wanting to learn more
about the narrative nature of the game. There is a whole Reddit, Discord, and
MeWe Group dedicated to the Genesys game. There's also a Facebook group, but I
do not do Facebook. There are also a number of informative podcasts and real
play podcasts which use Genesys and the Star Wars Roleplaying Game. If you can
get into the Discord group, MeWe and some of the others, then you can find
people to play with. Since its a narrative system and you don't really need
battle maps, you can play anywhere. You can still use battle maps, but its
an option as with any game.

Somethings that I felt that didn't play well for the Star Wars games and thus
the rise of Genesys was that Star Wars provided three separate tomes for their
settings. Each of these were a complete rewrite save for a few specific
mechanics or information about the universe. Then there was no PDF of the books
but I believe that has something to do with it being a digital title and EA
then having rights or something, it's all silly. If the core rules of the Star
Wars Roleplaying game could have been made separate then the individual
settings piled on top of it, they would've done better. That's what Genesys is
and its essentially the Narrative Dice System version 2.
